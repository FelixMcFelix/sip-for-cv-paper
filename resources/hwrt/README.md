# Note: You need to download this dataset!

Should be found [here](http://www.martin-thoma.de/write-math/data/) -- this is over 1 GB, and so cannot be stored on git (LFS or otherwise). C'est la vie!

Extract the csv files into this folder -- this should only be necessary if you need to reconstruct the letter images for later graph generation (i.e. using more pen-sizes).
