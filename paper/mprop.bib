  \citeauthor{SIP-VF2} introduce the VF2 algorithm for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem on sizable instances, which is stated to be more space-efficient than their prior VF algorithm.
  In particular, VF is augmented with more memory-efficient data structures for building candidate matches and evaluating state feasibility.
  The algorithm is compared against Ullmann's algorithm and the Nauty algorithm in runtime and complexity---it is found to generally outperform its contemporaries in graph isomorphism, except on random graphs with low connectivity.

  The work proposes a forward-checking algorithm (\emph{LAD}) for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem, based on a strong filtering procedure to prune branches of the search tree which admit no solution.
  This filtering technique makes use of \citeauthor{AllDiff}'s \emph{All-Different} general arc-consistent constraint propagator by posting a new AllDiff constraint on a node's neighbours after assignment.
  In comparison with VF2, ILF and Abscon, it generally outperforms its rivals on larger instances but is beaten on smaller instances due to the time complexity of filtering.

  A very strong filtering technique, \emph{SND}, designed for use in forward-checking solvers for the subgraph isomorphism problem is discussed, introduced as a generalisation of LAD filtering.
  \citeauthor{SIP-SND} establish a form of implied constraint: for arbitrary neighbourhood and scoring functions, after assignment a variable's neighbourhood must achieve a score no larger than the neighbourhood of its assigned value in the mapping.
  A specialisation of their framework is discussed wherein pattern vertices within a distance $k$ of one another must be mapped to target vertices at most a distance $k$ from one another---this weakened variant achieves a filtering level close to singleton arc-consistency, but is often slower in practice than LAD.

  \citeauthor{SIP-Glasgow} present an efficient algorithm for the subgraph isomorphism problem designed to exploit bit- and thread-parallelism to gain performance on multicore architectures.
  Their work combines graph preprocessing with a corollary of SND's principle to obtain implied constraints; the authors observe that an isomorphism between certain transformations of the pattern and target graphs $P$ and $T$ is itself an isomorphism between $P$ and $T$.
  Cheaper filtering alternatives which are ``good enough'' are used throughout to minimise the time spent evaluating each decision.
  Their algorithm is shown to outperform existing subgraph isomorphism solvers except on smaller instances where VF2 remains the most effective due to the substantial initialisation time required to construct any supplemental graphs.

  \citeauthor{TSIP-Short} consider the application of the subgraph isomorphism problem to temporal networks to find patterns inside of graphs which model entities which interact at recorded times with one another.
  They introduce the notation of \emph{time-respecting subgraphs} to capture semantically meaningful patterns within larger graphs and to provide a filtering which captures interaction patterns rather than relying strictly upon the labels.
  Two methods of search are considered, where the above transformation is performed either after or during the VF2 algorithm---an analysis on financial data shows that the latter approach achieves better performance.

  \citeauthor{SIP-Hard-Instances} examine the characteristics of instances of the subgraph isomorphism problem, investigating which parameters are more likely to make an instance more ``difficult'' than another and showing how to generate such instances.
  To this end they investigate phase transitions where problems are likely to become unsatisfiable, and show the times required for a portfolio of solvers to prove (un)satisfiability for both the induced and non-induced variants of the problem.
  Some discussion is provided on the applicability of any heuristics within the examined models to the generated problems.
  To show that regions of difficulty are inherent to the problem instances themselves (rather than the solvers), reductions of instances to SAT and Max-Clique are considered---the regions of difficulty remain in their original locations in these alternate formulations.

	Motivated by relative infeasibility of the maximum common subgraph problem compared to subgraph isomorphism, this work first considers a restricted form of the subgraph isomorphism problem: to find a pattern graph $P$ within a target graph $T$ such that some $k\in\mathbb{N}$ vertices go unmatched.
	By adapting the Glasgow solver \cite{SIP-Glasgow} for this restriction and iteratively solving for different values of $k$, a very competitive solver for the maximum common subgraph problem is proposed.

  \citeauthor{SIP-Ullmann} presents a standard backtracking algorithm for the subgraph isomorphism problem.
  This is augmented with  a \emph{refinement procedure} to perform search tree pruning---the current state in the search corresponds to a subgraph isomorphism if and only if this refinement procedure makes no changes to the current state.
  Additionally, the design of this refinement procedure allows for use in a parallel context.
  It is observed that this search tree pruning procedure performs graph isomorphism more quickly (and on a larger instance) than the basic backtracking search, although performs worse than its contemporaries when used to evaluate maximum clique.

  This work presents \emph{SIFT}---an algorithm for finding good keypoints for matching from regions of high variation in a multiscale representation of an image---and a procedure for matching objects between scenes from databases of these keypoints.
  The high dimensionality of these keypoints also leads to the creation of very distinct keypoints, reducing accidental mismatching.
  The approach is shown to introduce invariance to scale, rotation, illumination, partial occlusion, affine distortion and 3D viewpoint change.

  \citeauthor{Bacteria-Classification} examine the effectiveness of a visual classifier for bacterial colonies from image data.
  This is motivated by the fact that the visual properties of any one species might vary in relation to other bacteria in their environment.
  This is tackled in two stages: a convolutional deep belief network and support vector machine are used to classify image patches and pixels as foreground or background, before a convolutional neural network is used to label and classify colonies which lie in the foreground.
  Their framework is shown to achieve better performance than a SIFT-based classifier, but has difficulty when two colonies come into contact.

  A number of SIFT-like feature descriptors (SIFT, PCA-SIFT, GSIFT, CSIFT, SURF) are examined to compare their matching effectiveness, and determine which variants achieve the best accuracy under a given distortion.
  The execution time required to perform matchings and feature computation are also examined---SURF is considered to be the fastest feature detector, at the expense of accuracy and data dimensionality.
  Other SIFT variants tend to have fairly good accuracy in all cases, being more tuned for invariance against one or two classes of distortion.

  This work presents a machine learning approach for object recognition based on the application of progressively more complex classifiers---filtering out image regions which cannot possibly contain the desired object early on in search.
  The reliance on Haar-like features allows for the use of \emph{integral images}, a novel technique for computing integrals over these feature regions.
  This is proven to be both fast and accurate, but no mention is given on classifier robustness to distortion or the change in training set size to support such robustness.

  \citeauthor{ConvNet} explore the effectiveness of a deep convolutional neural network design against a large dataset with over 1000 labels attributed to objects.
  In particular, their approach relies upon a fast GPU implementation of the convolution operation and the ability to split the layered design over two GPUs to bypass single-card memory limitations.
  Methods for reducing overfitting and increasing learning rate during training are discussed, and the model is observed to have a considerably lower error rate than its closest competitor against an established benchmark.
  Removal of convolutional layers is show to have a negative impact on classification accuracy, demonstrating the advantages of additional depth.

  \citeauthor{Plane-Graphs-From-Images} present an algorithm for converting images into plane graphs for matching, which also serve as a form of image compression.
  Images are segmented, interest pixels are extracted, preliminary plane graphs are built and triangulated, and faces are assigned colours---it is asserted that this approach preserves segment shapes in the graph representation.
  The approach, tested against perfectly segmented images, produces satisfactory loss on images after reconstruction but no evaluation is given to the performance of these graphs in matching or any robustness the graph generation procedure holds.

  The authors examine the validity of graph similarity as a metric for facial recognition between pairs of complete graphs built from image keypoints.
  The use of SIFT is motivated by a desire to gain robustness against illumination and partial occlusion of the subject.
  Due to the large quantity of nodes and accidental matches that SIFT keypoints create, \citeauthor{SIFT-Graph-Topology-Faces} examine methods of filtering and weighting keypoints and their contribution to the dissimilarity metric.
  They find their symmetric-correspondence filtering to be effective, and typically achieve the desired robustness on their test data.

  This paper considers a variant of the subgraph isomorphism problem applicable to face-connected plane graphs---by transforming such graphs into \emph{combinatorial maps} it is possible to model face structure explicitly.
  An algorithm is demonstrated to find a copy of one such structure within another in polynomial time, which is then evaluated against image data sets---built by taking the Delaunay triangulation over all interest pixels.
  In particular, a rotated cropping of a large image is shown to be located within its original context in a faster time than the VF2 SIP algorithm could achieve.

  An exploration of the viability of graph modellings in handwriting recognition.
  \citeauthor{Graphs-Handwriting} present a portfolio of algorithms to generate attributed graphs from word images based on keypoints, fixed-size segmentation, and adaptive segmentation.
  Additionally, a machine learning-based approach for performing the matching task is proposed, using k-Nearest Neighbours with an approximation of graph edit distance.
  In practice, the adaptive segmentation approaches are found to achieve both the best classification performance \emph{and} the smallest graph sizes, with no comment on the associated computation time for matching.

  The authors present an unsupervised method for recovering inherent structure in high-dimensional data.
  By considering an approach grounded in topology, they are able to capture more complex structures than the mixture of Gaussians of standard spectral clustering techniques.
  The authors hypothesise that structures for data clustering typically occur in a lower-dimensionality space than the data itself.
  Detailed mathematical proof is given for the validity of this technique as well as their theorem that (up to some noise limit) the required sample count to detect such features relies upon the feature's dimensionality and \emph{not} that of the data.
