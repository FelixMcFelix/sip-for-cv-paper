Work on graph generation from character images, and recognition using these graphs.

Full instructions for running experiments are located in "code/".

Anything on my analysis of Samuel, Higuera and Janodet's approach is in "past-work/"

## Prerequisites

* Python 2.7.x (Numpy, sklearn, networkX)
* A modern C++14 compiler (gcc 5.4.1 works nicely)
* gnuplot
* ImageMagick
