# SIP / MCS solver (attributed multigraphs)

Modification of [Hoffmann, McCreesh and Reilly's algorithm](https://github.com/ciaranm/aaai17-between-subgraph-isomorphism-and-maximum-common-subgraph-paper) to support the required data format for my analysis.
Specifically, for undirected attributed multigraphs.
